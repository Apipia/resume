  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a cybersecurity professional specializing in application security with a passion for teaching. I’ve led initiatives in vulnerability management, static analysis, and security champion development, helping organizations reduce risk and integrate security into their development lifecycles. I’m especially driven by combining my technical expertise with education, empowering teams to adopt best practices and build lasting security solutions. Whether consulting with clients or leading security training sessions, I thrive in environments where I can share knowledge and foster collaboration. My goal is to continue driving security innovation while mentoring the next generation of professionals.

  <h2>Starbucks - Vulnerability Managment</h2>
  <p>
    At Starbucks, I led the design and implementation of a world-class Vulnerability Management program across the technology organization. By combining best-in-class vendor tools with automation and real-time dashboards, we were able to significantly reduced risk and delivered measurable impact at scale. Years later, I’m proud to say the foundation we built remains strong. I’m deeply passionate about what makes a vulnerability management program truly effective — from organizational alignment to scalable technical controls — and I bring strong, experience-backed opinions on how to do it right.

  <h2>Zoom - Static Analysis Program</h2>
  <p>
    At Zoom, I built a Static Analysis program from the ground up, centered around Checkmarx. More than just configuring and administering the tool, I developed a comprehensive program with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, seamlessly integrating it into the existing Security Champion framework. The program was powered by automation, supported by actionable metrics, and surfaced through intuitive dashboards — making it both scalable and sustainable. It remains a strong example of how to embed security tools effectively into the SDLC.

  <h2>Trilogy Education - Teaching</h2>
  <p>
    At Trilogy, I led a cohort of approximately 30 students through an intensive eight-week cybersecurity bootcamp — designed to cover the field a mile wide and an inch deep. The course prepared participants to successfully earn their Security+ certification and, more importantly, gave them a strong foundation to launch or transition into cybersecurity careers. Teaching is something I view as a core part of my purpose, and I take pride in creating an inclusive, high-impact learning environment. Several students were able to break into the field thanks to the practical skills and strategies we covered, and many shared that it was the best technical instruction they’d ever received.

  <h2>Carvana - Security Champions & Bug Bounty</h2>
  <p>
    At Carvana, I led the Bug Bounty program and transformed it into a world-class example of how to run a bug bounty effectively. Researchers consistently praised our responsiveness and communication, with many citing it as one of their favorite programs to engage with. In addition to managing the Bug Bounty program, I built and led the Security Champion initiative, where I designed secure developer training and cultivated a community of security-driven developers. These developers became key allies to the application security team, contributing to a more secure and proactive development culture across the organization.

  <h2>Optiv - Secure SDLC Assessments & Web Application Testing</h2>
  <p>
    At Optiv, I collaborate closely with clients to support their web application assessment needs and broader application security strategy. My work primarily involves conducting web application assessments, Secure SDLC Maturity assessments, and developing hardening plans. I also help clients operate and mature their security tooling programs, ensuring they have the right processes in place to manage security effectively. Where I truly thrive, however, is in blending my technical expertise with my passion for teaching. For several clients, I’ve led hands-on security training sessions for their developers, helping them improve their security practices and fostering long-term, valuable relationships.

  <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
  <p>
    I’m interested in opportunities that allow me to combine my deep technical expertise in cybersecurity with my passion for teaching. I’m also particularly excited about building world-class security solutions in the application security space, where I can create lasting impact through automation and well-crafted programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a unique blend of a highly technical application security engineer and an educator, I excel in bridging the gap between complex security concepts and real-world application. Whether in front of an audience or working directly with clients, I thrive in fostering relationships that drive value and long-term growth.
